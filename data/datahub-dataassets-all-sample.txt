The Federal Highway Administration’s Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), in conjunction with the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center,  tested and evaluated this prototype system in 2016. Researchers in the Saxton Transportation Operations Laboratory at TFHRC designed and built the Cooperative Automated Research Mobility Applications (CARMA) platform version 1 that enables the implementation of the proof-of-concept CACC-based platooning in passenger vehicles equipped with production adaptive cruise control, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). The data characterize the state-of-the-art capability of the CACC application based on engineering tests that were performed on closed tracks by professional drivers and using prescribed test procedures. The test data are separated into sets that correspond to test date and time, and test run number. The data include performance parameters that were collected from the CACC application and data acquisition systems, including vehicle controller area network data, CARMA's MicroAutoBox, DSRC radios, and an independent measurement system. The tests were conducted at US Army’s Aberdeen Test Center located at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD.

{"id":"hgmr-wk87","name":"Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Costs","description":"The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) established the ITS Costs Database as a national resource for transportation professionals to go to in order to obtain cost estimates for ITS deployments. The purpose of the ITS Costs Database is to support informed decision-making by transportation leaders.\n\nThe ITS Costs Database contains estimates of ITS costs that can be used for developing project cost estimates during the planning process or preliminary design phase, and for policy studies and cost-benefit analyses. Both non-recurring (capital) and recurring (operating and maintenance) costs are provided where possible.\n\nTwo types of cost data are available: unit costs and system cost summaries. System cost summaries are the costs of an ITS project or portion of an ITS project such as the cost of expanding a statewide road weather information system or the detailed costs for a signal interconnect project. Each entry describes the background of the project, the ITS technologies deployed, and presents the costs and what the costs covered. A breakout of components and costs is provided for most summaries depending on the information available. Both capital costs and annual O&M costs are presented whenever possible. Unit costs are the costs associated with an individual ITS element, such as a video camera for traffic surveillance or a dynamic message sign. A range of costs (e.g., $500 - $1,000) is presented for the capital cost and annual operations and maintenance (O&M) cost of each element as well as an estimate of the length in years of its usable life. Unit costs are available in two formats: unadjusted and adjusted. Unadjusted costs are presented as the original value along with the dollar year.","accessLevel":"Public","lastUpdate":"2019-05-13T19:28:48Z","tags":["arterial management","crash prevention and safety","capital costs","evaluation","transportation management centers","its joint program office (jpo)","roadway operations and maintenance","road weather management","operational costs","its knowledge resources","driver assistance","intelligent transportation systems (its)","costs","freeway management","automated vehicles","connected vehicles","project costs"],"sourceUrl":"https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Intelligent-Transportation-Systems-ITS-Costs/hgmr-wk87","dhId":"[scgc]-hgmr-wk87","dhLastUpdate":"2019-10-09T14:33:08Z","dhSourceName":"scgc"}
